##  About Team👥

Picture

**Introducing Team F1 from Yothinburana School**

We are a group of students from **Yothinburana School** who share a strong passion for programming and robotics. All three of us are active members of the school’s **Robotics Club**, which has around 30 members. We each joined the club in **Grade 7 (Mathayom 1)**, driven by a love for technology and building things from scratch.

Our team is called **"F1"**, inspired by our shared enthusiasm for **Formula 1 racing**. Beyond just being fans, we dream of one day designing and building our own **self-driving vehicle** — a goal that keeps us motivated and united as a team.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meet the Team

| Name       | Role                           | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chaiwat Chinsupawat** _(myself)_ | 📚 Team Organizer               | Handles documentation, presentations, and manages the team's workflow         |
| **Pongpapat Putongkam**          | 🛠️ Mechanic                    | Designs and assembles the robot’s hardware and structural components          |
| **Peradon Nimsongprasert**            | 💻 Programmer                  | Codes and refines the robot’s software and logic                              |

> 🧒 Peradon is two years younger than Chaiwat and Pongpapat but brings equal energy and skill to the team!

## 🤝 How We Work

Even though we come from different age groups, we collaborate seamlessly. Each of us brings **unique strengths** to the team, and our clearly divided roles allow us to stay focused and productive.

We believe in:
- 🔄 Continuous collaboration
- 📖 Learning from one another
- 💡 Innovating with each challenge

<br>

## 💬 Our Mission

> _"We’re not just building robots — we’re building a future."_  

Our goal is to **innovate, build**, and one day **revolutionize autonomous vehicles**. Every challenge we face is a chance to grow, both as engineers and as a team.

<br>

in another and grow as future engineers. No matter the challenge, we stay focused on our shared dream:  
**to innovate, build, and someday revolutionize how autonomous vehicles are made.**
