# Robot Design

For the past two years, we have continuously refined our robot through participation in the WRO Future Engineers competition, advancing to the international rounds twice:
-  **WRO PANAMA 2023**  
-  **WRO TÜRKİYE 2024**  

These experiences gave us valuable insights into how to design robots that are not only competitive but also robust, precise, and adaptable. Our current robot design builds directly on the lessons learned from our previous generations, with a stronger focus on precision engineering, durability under stress, and consistent performance in dynamic environments.

---

## 🖥️ Design Software

At the beginning of this year’s design process, we experimented with five different design tools to explore their capabilities and limitations. While Blender offered a user-friendly and intuitive interface, we realized that it lacked the precision required for engineering-grade robotics. For the first time, we made the shift to a professional-grade CAD tool — Autodesk Fusion 360.

This decision was driven by the increasing complexity of our robot’s hardware. As we upgraded our electronic components, our mechanical structures also needed to achieve tighter tolerances and higher stability. Fusion 360 enables us to design with millimeter-level accuracy, which is critical for ensuring that sensors, motors, and moving parts align perfectly. Furthermore, its integrated simulation tools allow us to test stress points, weight distribution, and kinematics virtually, reducing trial-and-error during physical assembly.

By combining CAD precision with our team’s 3D design expertise, we have created a robot that not only looks refined in digital models but also translates seamlessly into a high-performance physical build.

# Steering Mechanic Part
<p align="center">
<img width="732" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674a9b35-0594-456e-b30d-0957e6978937" />


This Future Engineering mission, teams need to build a self-driving car and the steering mechanic determind its direction.
In our previous generation robot, we use the "Parallel steering" mechanism in which the wheels angle is equal on both side. With this
mechanism, we encounter alot of sliping at both front and back of the car which made it drift and lose its balance. So after our research,
we decided to use the "Akerman steering" mechanism. But there are two type of this particular mechanism; "Akerman",which is use globally in any manufactured cars and "Anti-Akerman", which is commonly use in formula series racing cars. "Akerman steering" is when a car is turning, the steering angle is different on both wheel with a tigher angle on the inside and a wider angle on the other side because while turnng the inside wheel turn at a smaller radius while the outside wheel is turning at a larger radius. This eliminate the scrubing(sliding) of the tires and made the turn more smooth. The "Anti-Akerman" on the other hand is the opposite with the outside wheel turnig at a thigher angle generate more grip which is need in a formula car, but it is more difficult to control (the down force generate by formula cars compensate these flaws).
In short, the "Akerman steering" mechanism is out best choice and will definitely improve out robot.

The SPG20HP-20K, also well-known as the GM25 motor, is a compact DC geared motor paired with a 20:1 gearbox. It can deliver up to 225 mN·m torque with a no-load speed of 980 RPM, making it highly suitable for small-sized mobile robots, sumo robots, and other automation projects. With its standard size and availability of different gear ratios, the motor can be easily swapped without requiring modifications to the robot’s design.

The rated operating voltage of this motor is 12V. Running it at a lower voltage may result in insufficient torque to drive wheels or mechanisms effectively, while using a higher voltage can increase torque and speed but may also reduce the overall lifespan of the motor.

Before selecting this motor, our team initially used the LEGO™ Power Functions Large Motor as the main driving motor. However, during testing we encountered a major issue: when reducing the speed, the motor did not provide enough torque to reliably move the robot. This limitation made it unsuitable for our competition requirements. As a solution, we switched to the Chihai Motor 25-370K, which offers both the torque and reliability necessary to ensure stable movement and performance throughout the WRO Future Engineers 2025 challenge.

A differential gear (commonly called a differential) is a special gear system used in vehicles to allow the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds while still being powered by the same engine or motor. When combined with the Ackermann steering mechanism, it enables smoother and more efficient movement for our robot.

You might wonder, “Why LEGO?” The reason is that our school has limited facilities, which prevents us from manufacturing our own components. As a result, we rely on pre-manufactured LEGO parts. According to the regulations, teams are not allowed to use a pre-built chassis, but standard parts are permitted.

Using LEGO parts not only ensures that the differential gear works reliably, but also allows us to easily obtain multiple identical spare parts when needed.

The System includes multiple parts:
   -Technic, Gear Differential Housing : 65414
   -Technic, Gear 12 Tooth Bevel : 6589
   -Technic, Gear 28 Tooth Double Bevel with Pin Hole : 65413

## ZX-03 Reflective Infrared Sensor Module
<p align="center">
  <img width="475" height="475" alt="BLUE Light Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24a4812-1aa1-4804-b3f3-0850d43454d7" />

We use a red sensor to detect the blue line, and a blue sensor to detect the red line. The reason is that optical sensors detect objects more effectively when the emitted light wavelength is different from the color of the target surface. The contrast between the sensor light and the line color increases the reflection difference, resulting in higher accuracy and more reliable detection.

**Description**
This module contains a TCRT5000, which integrates an infrared LED and a phototransistor in a single package. When power is supplied, the LED emits infrared light in a wide beam. If an object is placed in front of the sensor, the phototransistor receives the reflected infrared light and allows current to flow. This generates a voltage drop at the S (Vout) pin. The output voltage level depends on the intensity of the reflected infrared light received by the phototransistor — stronger reflections result in higher output voltage, while weaker reflections produce lower voltage.

The TCRT5000 Infrared Reflectance Obstacle Avoidance Line Tracking Sensor is an optical sensor that utilizes infrared (IR) light technology to detect objects and reflective surfaces. It works by emitting infrared light through an IR LED, and then measuring the amount of light reflected back to its built-in phototransistor.

Because of this simple yet effective principle, the TCRT5000 is widely used in robotics and automation projects. One of its most common applications is in line-following robots, where the sensor can distinguish between dark lines and light backgrounds by measuring differences in IR reflectivity. Additionally, it can serve as a short-range proximity sensor, making it suitable for obstacle detection, object counting, and motion tracking systems.

This sensor is popular among students, hobbyists, and engineers alike due to its low cost, compact design, and reliable performance. Its versatility and ease of integration make it an excellent choice for educational projects, competitions, and prototype development.

## OpenMV Cam H7
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="700" alt="RED Light Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68657480-1a8d-4b59-bd59-5ddaf186fa74" /> 
  
The OpenMV Cam is a small, low-power microcontroller board that allows developers to easily implement real-world applications using machine vision. It can be programmed using high-level Python scripts through the MicroPython Operating System, which makes handling complex outputs from machine vision algorithms and high-level data structures much simpler than traditional C/C++ programming. Despite this high-level approach, users still have full control over the OpenMV Cam’s I/O pins, enabling precise interactions with sensors, motors, and other hardware components.

Users can trigger picture or video capture based on external events, or execute machine vision algorithms to make real-time decisions for controlling I/O pins.

In our project for WRO Future Engineers 2025, the OpenMV Cam is used for color detection and parking detection:
- During the Obstacle Challenge, the camera identifies block colors. If a block is green, the robot will turn around it to the left; if the block is red, it will turn around it to the right.
- The camera is also used to detect parking areas before the robot enters, ensuring precise and safe parking.

By integrating the OpenMV Cam, our robot gains intelligent perception capabilities, allowing it to react dynamically to obstacles and navigate autonomously in complex environments.

<img width="400" height="400" alt="ดีไซน์ที่ยังไม่ได้ตั้งชื่อ (34)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/741ad15e-eb57-48ac-afc9-9784bae76ae3" />

The Gravity: BNO055 + BMP280 10DOF AHRS is an advanced sensor module that integrates BNO055 and BMP280 on a single board, creating a compact 10 Degrees-of-Freedom (10DOF) sensor for intelligent orientation and environmental sensing.

BNO055 is a small, powerful 9-axis Absolute Orientation Sensor. It is a system-in-package that combines:
- A triaxial 14-bit accelerometer
- A triaxial 16-bit gyroscope
- A triaxial geomagnetic sensor
- A 32-bit microcontroller

At only 5.2 x 3.8 x 1.1 mm³, it is significantly smaller than comparable discrete or system-on-board solutions. BNO055 not only provides raw data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and geomagnetic sensors, but also outputs fused data such as quaternions, Euler angles, and vectors. Its built-in MCU handles complex sensor fusion algorithms, freeing users from manual processing and enabling fast integration into projects like smartphones, wearable devices, and robotics.

BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor that measures both pressure and temperature, which can be converted to altitude using specific formulas. It uses Bosch’s proven piezoresistive pressure technology, offering high accuracy, linearity, long-term stability, and EMC robustness, making it ideal for mobile and embedded applications.

By combining these two sensors, the 10DOF AHRS module provides orientation and environmental sensing in one compact package. The standard Gravity I2C interface simplifies integration, avoiding the complications of multiple sensors from different vendors and saving time for product innovation. This module is ideal for applications such as:
- Wearable hardware
- Augmented reality and immersive gaming
- Personal health and fitness devices
- Indoor navigation and robotics

Any application requiring reliable context awareness

In our project, we previously used the ZX-IMU, but we encountered frequent drift and instability in gyroscope readings. To achieve more stable and reliable orientation data, we switched to the Gravity BNO055 + BMP280 10DOF AHRS, which ensures precise navigation and performance in the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition.

The Sensor Shield V5.0 is an expansion board designed to simplify the connection of various sensors, servos, and modules to the Arduino Uno and other compatible boards.  
It breaks out Arduino I/O pins into easy-to-use 3-pin headers (VCC, GND, Signal), making it convenient to connect multiple devices without messy wiring or soldering.  
This shield supports a wide range of modules such as ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, servos, relays, and communication modules (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.).  
With clearly labeled pins and dedicated ports for I²C and UART communication, the Sensor Shield V5.0 is a versatile tool for rapid prototyping and robotics projects.

**Why We Use It**
We chose the Sensor Shield V5.0 because it provides a clean, stable, and organized way to connect multiple sensors and modules to the Arduino Uno.  
For the **WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition**, wiring stability and reliability are critical during testing and competition rounds.  
This shield eliminates the risk of loose jumper wires, saves time during setup, and ensures error-free sensor integration.  
It allows us to quickly swap or test different sensors without rewiring the entire circuit, which is especially useful in competitions where adjustments are often needed.

**Description**
The Firefox Li-Polymer Battery (20C, 1300mAh, 11.1V) is a high-performance rechargeable Li-Po battery designed to provide stable and powerful current output for motors and robotics applications.  
With its 20C discharge rate, the battery can deliver bursts of high current, making it suitable for driving motors that require strong torque and consistent performance.  
Its compact size and lightweight build make it ideal for robotics projects where both efficiency and power-to-weight ratio are important.

**Why We Use It**
We selected the **Firefox Li-Polymer 11.1V 1300mAh** battery because it provides enough power to run the **Chihai Motor 25-370K** at full efficiency.  
During testing, we found that this battery delivers strong current without quickly discharging, ensuring longer operation time.  

In previous years, we used the **Helicox 2200mAh (7.4V / 11.1V) 30C** battery, but we faced the problem that it drained too quickly, lasting only 2–3 runs before needing replacement.  
To solve this issue, we switched to the Firefox Li-Po, which maintains more stable discharge characteristics and matches our system’s power demand better.  

This makes the Firefox battery the best balance between **power, stability, and endurance**, giving our robot reliable performance throughout the **WRO Future Engineers 2025** challenge.

##On/Off Switch : SPST ON/OFF Switch 2 Pin Rocker Switch DC 125/250V
This switch is for cutting the power from the battery to the robot. The regulation states that before starting the robot, the power must be cut off. That's when this switch came in. To use this switch we solder red wire(Positive pole) to the switch on 1 side for input. Then another solder red wire for output on the opposite side. You can put the black wire(Negative pole) straight into the step down. When the switch is turned on, the power from the battery will direct into the stepdown and then the robot.

## **Step-down** : HW-360 V6.0
This is a step-down DC-DC module. It comes with a status indicator light, a display screen that shows the voltage meter, and self-calibration of the voltage meter. The electrical voltage has an error of 0.05 V, with a measuring range of 0–40 V. We need this step down to show us how long until we need to recharge the battery.
