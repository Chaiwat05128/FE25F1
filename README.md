## Robot Design

For the past two years, we have continuously refined our robot through participation in the WRO Future Engineers competition, advancing to the international rounds twice:
-  **WRO PANAMA 2023**  
-  **WRO TÜRKİYE 2024**  

These experiences gave us valuable insights into how to design robots that are not only competitive but also robust, precise, and adaptable. Our current robot design builds directly on the lessons learned from our previous generations, with a stronger focus on precision engineering, durability under stress, and consistent performance in dynamic environments.

---

### 🖥️ Design Software

At the beginning of this year’s design process, we experimented with five different design tools to explore their capabilities and limitations. While Blender offered a user-friendly and intuitive interface, we realized that it lacked the precision required for engineering-grade robotics. For the first time, we made the shift to a professional-grade CAD tool — Autodesk Fusion 360.

This decision was driven by the increasing complexity of our robot’s hardware. As we upgraded our electronic components, our mechanical structures also needed to achieve tighter tolerances and higher stability. Fusion 360 enables us to design with millimeter-level accuracy, which is critical for ensuring that sensors, motors, and moving parts align perfectly. Furthermore, its integrated simulation tools allow us to test stress points, weight distribution, and kinematics virtually, reducing trial-and-error during physical assembly.

By combining CAD precision with our team’s 3D design expertise, we have created a robot that not only looks refined in digital models but also translates seamlessly into a high-performance physical build.

## Steering Mechanic Part
<p align="center">
<img width="732" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674a9b35-0594-456e-b30d-0957e6978937" />


This Future Engineering mission, teams need to build a self-driving car and the steering mechanic determind its direction.
In our previous generation robot, we use the "Parallel steering" mechanism in which the wheels angle is equal on both side. With this
mechanism, we encounter alot of sliping at both front and back of the car which made it drift and lose its balance. So after our research,
we decided to use the "Akerman steering" mechanism. But there are two type of this particular mechanism; "Akerman",which is use globally in any manufactured cars and "Anti-Akerman", which is commonly use in formula series racing cars. "Akerman steering" is when a car is turning, the steering angle is different on both wheel with a tigher angle on the inside and a wider angle on the other side because while turnng the inside wheel turn at a smaller radius while the outside wheel is turning at a larger radius. This eliminate the scrubing(sliding) of the tires and made the turn more smooth. The "Anti-Akerman" on the other hand is the opposite with the outside wheel turnig at a thigher angle generate more grip which is need in a formula car, but it is more difficult to control (the down force generate by formula cars compensate these flaws).
In short, the "Akerman steering" mechanism is out best choice and will definitely improve out robot.

 **How We Steer the Robot?**  

We use the **Geek Servo 360**, a compact yet powerful servo motor with:  
- **360° rotation**  
- **Max torque**: 1.6 kg·cm  
- **Turning speed**: 60° in 0.14s  
- **Weight**: only 20g  
- **LEGO-compatible mount**, making it easy to attach to the robot fram
  
### **⚙️ Geek Servo 360**

- ⚡ **Fast response (0.14s/60°)** → quick steering corrections, ideal for sharp curves on the WRO track  
- 💪 **High torque (1.6 kg·cm @ 6V)** → strong enough to turn wheels even under load  
- 🔄 **360° continuous rotation** → allows us to experiment with advanced control algorithms (like PID steering)  
- 🪶 **Lightweight (20g)** → keeps overall robot weight low for better acceleration  

Unlike regular LEGO servos, the Geek Servo 360 offers **higher precision and control flexibility**. This makes it especially useful for **Ackermann steering**, where smooth wheel angles are essential to reduce slipping and drifting.  

> **In short:** the Geek Servo 360 is the perfect match for our steering system — **LEGO-friendly, powerful, fast, and precise.**

Why We Use It:
- Compact (20g) → keeps robot light and agile
- LEGO-compatible mount → fits easily into our frame

## 🚗 Drive and Power Train

### **Chihai Motor 25-370K**

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" height="600" alt="Motor12V 980RPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bd6fa35-99c0-4764-aa84-4913e5cc0cb3" />

The SPG20HP-20K, also well-known as the GM25 motor, is a compact DC geared motor paired with a 20:1 gearbox. It can deliver up to 225 mN·m torque with a no-load speed of 980 RPM, making it highly suitable for small-sized mobile robots, sumo robots, and other automation projects. With its standard size and availability of different gear ratios, the motor can be easily swapped without requiring modifications to the robot’s design.

The rated operating voltage of this motor is 12V. Running it at a lower voltage may result in insufficient torque to drive wheels or mechanisms effectively, while using a higher voltage can increase torque and speed but may also reduce the overall lifespan of the motor.

Before selecting this motor, our team initially used the LEGO™ Power Functions Large Motor as the main driving motor. However, during testing we encountered a major issue: when reducing the speed, the motor did not provide enough torque to reliably move the robot. This limitation made it unsuitable for our competition requirements. As a solution, we switched to the Chihai Motor 25-370K, which offers both the torque and reliability necessary to ensure stable movement and performance throughout the WRO Future Engineers 2025 challenge.

### **LEGO Technic Differential gear** 
<p align="center">
 <img width="550" height="550" alt="LEGO Differential gear" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c012737-d0ed-4d62-82b5-511427b94b39" />


A differential gear (commonly called a differential) is a special gear system used in vehicles to allow the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds while still being powered by the same engine or motor. When combined with the Ackermann steering mechanism, it enables smoother and more efficient movement for our robot.

You might wonder, “Why LEGO?” The reason is that our school has limited facilities, which prevents us from manufacturing our own components. As a result, we rely on pre-manufactured LEGO parts. According to the regulations, teams are not allowed to use a pre-built chassis, but standard parts are permitted.

Using LEGO parts not only ensures that the differential gear works reliably, but also allows us to easily obtain multiple identical spare parts when needed.

The System includes multiple parts:
   -Technic, Gear Differential Housing : 65414
   -Technic, Gear 12 Tooth Bevel : 6589
   -Technic, Gear 28 Tooth Double Bevel with Pin Hole : 65413

### ZX-03 Reflective Infrared Sensor Module
<p align="center">
  <img width="475" height="475" alt="BLUE Light Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24a4812-1aa1-4804-b3f3-0850d43454d7" />
  <img width="400" height="400" alt="RED Light Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ede64ba2-939b-4fe5-bf36-bd700def520f" />

We use a red sensor to detect the blue line, and a blue sensor to detect the red line. The reason is that optical sensors detect objects more effectively when the emitted light wavelength is different from the color of the target surface. The contrast between the sensor light and the line color increases the reflection difference, resulting in higher accuracy and more reliable detection.

**Description**
This module contains a TCRT5000, which integrates an infrared LED and a phototransistor in a single package. When power is supplied, the LED emits infrared light in a wide beam. If an object is placed in front of the sensor, the phototransistor receives the reflected infrared light and allows current to flow. This generates a voltage drop at the S (Vout) pin. The output voltage level depends on the intensity of the reflected infrared light received by the phototransistor — stronger reflections result in higher output voltage, while weaker reflections produce lower voltage.

The TCRT5000 Infrared Reflectance Obstacle Avoidance Line Tracking Sensor is an optical sensor that utilizes infrared (IR) light technology to detect objects and reflective surfaces. It works by emitting infrared light through an IR LED, and then measuring the amount of light reflected back to its built-in phototransistor.

Because of this simple yet effective principle, the TCRT5000 is widely used in robotics and automation projects. One of its most common applications is in line-following robots, where the sensor can distinguish between dark lines and light backgrounds by measuring differences in IR reflectivity. Additionally, it can serve as a short-range proximity sensor, making it suitable for obstacle detection, object counting, and motion tracking systems.

This sensor is popular among students, hobbyists, and engineers alike due to its low cost, compact design, and reliable performance. Its versatility and ease of integration make it an excellent choice for educational projects, competitions, and prototype development.

### OpenMV Cam H7
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="700" alt="RED Light Sensor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68657480-1a8d-4b59-bd59-5ddaf186fa74" /> 
  
The OpenMV Cam is a small, low-power microcontroller board that allows developers to easily implement real-world applications using machine vision. It can be programmed using high-level Python scripts through the MicroPython Operating System, which makes handling complex outputs from machine vision algorithms and high-level data structures much simpler than traditional C/C++ programming. Despite this high-level approach, users still have full control over the OpenMV Cam’s I/O pins, enabling precise interactions with sensors, motors, and other hardware components.

Users can trigger picture or video capture based on external events, or execute machine vision algorithms to make real-time decisions for controlling I/O pins.

In our project for WRO Future Engineers 2025, the OpenMV Cam is used for color detection and parking detection:
- During the Obstacle Challenge, the camera identifies block colors. If a block is green, the robot will turn around it to the left; if the block is red, it will turn around it to the right.
- The camera is also used to detect parking areas before the robot enters, ensuring precise and safe parking.

By integrating the OpenMV Cam, our robot gains intelligent perception capabilities, allowing it to react dynamically to obstacles and navigate autonomously in complex environments.
