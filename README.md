##  About Team 👥

Picture

**Introducing Team F1 from Yothinburana School**

We are a group of students from **Yothinburana School** who share a strong passion for programming and robotics. All three of us are active members of the school’s **Robotics Club**, which has around 30 members. We each joined the club in **Grade 7 (Mathayom 1)**, driven by a love for technology and building things from scratch.

Our team is called **"F1"**, inspired by our shared enthusiasm for **Formula 1 racing**. Beyond just being fans, we dream of one day designing and building our own **self-driving vehicle** — a goal that keeps us motivated and united as a team.

<br>

## Robot Design

For the past 2 years, we have been competing in the **WRO Future Engineer** and have advanced to the international round twice:  
-  **WRO PANAMA 2023**  
-  **WRO TÜRKİYE 2024**  

Our current robot design builds on the strengths of our previous generation robots, focusing on **precision, durability, and performance**.

---

### 🖥️ Design Software

This year, we started with 5 different design tools.  
Although **Blender** is very easy and straightforward to use, we decided to switch to a professional tool for the first time — **Autodesk Fusion 360**.  
With improvements in our electronic components, our mechanical hardware needed to be more precise.  
Fusion 360 provides **millimeter-level precision**, which is essential for our designs.

### Steering Mechanic Part
<p align="center">
<img width="732" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674a9b35-0594-456e-b30d-0957e6978937" />


This Future Engineering mission, teams need to build a self-driving car and the steering mechanic determind its direction.
In our previous generation robot, we use the "Parallel steering" mechanism in which the wheels angle is equal on both side. With this
mechanism, we encounter alot of sliping at both front and back of the car which made it drift and lose its balance. So after our research,
we decided to use the "Akerman steering" mechanism. But there are two type of this particular mechanism; "Akerman",which is use globally in any manufactured cars and "Anti-Akerman", which is commonly use in formula series racing cars. "Akerman steering" is when a car is turning, the steering angle is different on both wheel with a tigher angle on the inside and a wider angle on the other side because while turnng the inside wheel turn at a smaller radius while the outside wheel is turning at a larger radius. This eliminate the scrubing(sliding) of the tires and made the turn more smooth. The "Anti-Akerman" on the other hand is the opposite with the outside wheel turnig at a thigher angle generate more grip which is need in a formula car, but it is more difficult to control (the down force generate by formula cars compensate these flaws).
In short, the "Akerman steering" mechanism is out best choice and will definitely improve out robot.

 **How We Steer the Robot**  

We use the **Geek Servo 360**, a compact yet powerful servo motor with:  
- **360° rotation**

### 🚗 Drive and Power Train

#### **Chihai Motor 25-370K**

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" alt="Motor12V 980RPM" src="https://static.cytron.io/image/cache/catalog/products/SPG20HP-20K/spg20hp-20k-a-800x800.jpg"/>
  
SPG20HP-20K is also well-known as GM25 motor, a small-size geared motor coupled with a 20:1 gearbox that is able to produce 225mN.m torque with 980 RPM (no load). It is a DC geared motor, ideal for building small-sized mobile robots for sumo, small automation models, and of course other applications too. With the standard size and variety of gear ratios, users can always change the motor without changing the existing robot design.

The rated voltage is 12V. Lower voltage might not have enough torque to drive the wheel or mechanism; higher voltage will provide higher torque and higher speed, but it will shorten the life of the motor. You may need the 10A Sumo Robot Controller to control this motor

**Specification**
- High Power
- Rated Voltage: 12VDC
- Rated Current: 2.7A
- Stall Current: < 16A
- Rated Speed: 780 RPM
- No Load Speed: 980 RPM
- Rated Load Torque: 225mN.m (2.3kgf.cm)
- Gear Ratio: 20:1

**⚙️ Motor Specifications**

**Model:** CHR-GM25-BK370  
**Type:** Permanent Magnet DC Gear Motor  
**Voltage:** DC 6.0V / 12.0V  
**Max Power:** 8W (6V), 26W (12V)  
**Input Motor Speed:** 10,000 RPM (6V), 20,000 RPM (12V)  
**Max Torque:** 8.0 kg·cm (0.8 N·m)  
**Note:** Requires a **10A or higher power supply** due to high power/current.

**🔹 DC 12.0V (Max Power 26W, Input Speed 20,000 RPM)**

### Energy management and inspection
#### Gravity: URM09 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor 
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" alt="LEGO Wheel and Tire Set 2" src="https://github.com/Frances9/SEN0307/blob/master/DFR0307_WIKI_Cover.jpg?raw=true"/>

This is an ultrasonic sensor with an open dual-probe, employing standard interface of Gravity PH2.0-3P vertical patch socket. The module is compatible with controllers with 3.3V or 5V logical level, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

The sensor comes with built-in temperature compensation, which can greatly reduce measurement error caused by over high/low temperature. It adopts analog voltage output, and provides accurate distance measurement within 2-500cm with 1cm resolution and ±1% accuracy. The design of dual probe effectively decreases the dead zone. Users can check the measurement process conveniently by the onboard indicator.

This small ranging module can be used in an extensive range of applications, for instance, robots with obstacle avoidance function, backing car annunciator, doorbell etc.

**Specification**
- Power Supply: 3.3~5.5V DC
- Operating Current: 20mA
- Operating Temperature: -10℃～＋70℃
- Measurement Range: 2cm～500cm
- Resolution: 1cm
- Accuracy: 1%
- Acoustic Frequency: 38~42KHz
- Frequency: 30Hz Max
- Dimension: 47mm × 22 mm/1.85×0.87”
- Distance Formula: Distance=Vout(mV)×520/Vin(mV)
