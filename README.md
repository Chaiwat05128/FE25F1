###  About Team👥

Picture

**Introducing Team F1 from Yothinburana School**

We are a group of students from **Yothinburana School** who share a strong passion for programming and robotics. All three of us are active members of the school’s **Robotics Club**, which has around 30 members. We each joined the club in **Grade 7 (Mathayom 1)**, driven by a love for technology and building things from scratch.

Our team is called **"F1"**, inspired by our shared enthusiasm for **Formula 1 racing**. Beyond just being fans, we dream of one day designing and building our own **self-driving vehicle** — a goal that keeps us motivated and united as a team.

| **Chaiwat Chinsupawat** _(myself)_ | 📚 Team Organizer               | Handles documentation, presentations, and manages the team's workflow         |
| **Pongpapat Putongkam**          | 🛠️ Mechanic                    | Designs and assembles the robot’s hardware and structural components          |
| **Peradon Nimsongprasert**            | 💻 Programmer                  | Codes and refines the robot’s software and logic                              |

> 🧒 Peradon is two years younger than Chaiwat and Pongpapat but brings equal energy and skill to the team!

### 🤝 How We Work

Even though we come from different age groups, we collaborate seamlessly. Each of us brings **unique strengths** to the team, and our clearly divided roles allow us to stay focused and productive.

We believe in:
- 🔄 Continuous collaboration
- 📖 Learning from one another
- 💡 Innovating with each challenge

<br>

### 💬 Our Mission

> _"We’re not just building robots — we’re building a future."_  

Our goal is to **innovate, build**, and one day **revolutionize autonomous vehicles**. Every challenge we face is a chance to grow, both as engineers and as a team.

<br>

in another and grow as future engineers. No matter the challenge, we stay focused on our shared dream:  
**to innovate, build, and someday revolutionize how autonomous vehicles are made.**

## Robot Design
 For the past 2 years, we have been competing in this WRO mission and went on international round twice (WRO 2023 Panama and WRO 2024 Turkey).
 So our robot design will be the improvement of our previous generation robots. 
 
 #Design software

 (blender no fusion yes picture)

 Lets start with the designing tools. Eventhough using blender is very easy and stragiht forward, this year we decided to use a professional
 designing tool for the first time which is the "Autodesk Fusion 360". Due to our improvement of the other electronics parts, mechanic hard ware needs to be more precises. The  Fusion 360 provide us with precision down to milimeter.
