##  About Team 👥

Picture

**Introducing Team F1 from Yothinburana School**

We are a group of students from **Yothinburana School** who share a strong passion for programming and robotics. All three of us are active members of the school’s **Robotics Club**, which has around 30 members. We each joined the club in **Grade 7 (Mathayom 1)**, driven by a love for technology and building things from scratch.

Our team is called **"F1"**, inspired by our shared enthusiasm for **Formula 1 racing**. Beyond just being fans, we dream of one day designing and building our own **self-driving vehicle** — a goal that keeps us motivated and united as a team.

## Robot Design

For the past 2 years, we have been competing in the **WRO Future Engineer** and have advanced to the international round twice:  
-  **WRO PANAMA 2023**  
-  **WRO TÜRKİYE 2024**  

Our current robot design builds on the strengths of our previous generation robots, focusing on **precision, durability, and performance**.

---

### 🖥️ Design Software

This year, we started with 5 different design tools.  
Although **Blender** is very easy and straightforward to use, we decided to switch to a professional tool for the first time — **Autodesk Fusion 360**.  
With improvements in our electronic components, our mechanical hardware needed to be more precise.  
Fusion 360 provides **millimeter-level precision**, which is essential for our designs.

### Steering Mechanic Part
<p align="center">
<img width="732" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674a9b35-0594-456e-b30d-0957e6978937" />


This Future Engineering mission, teams need to build a self-driving car and the steering mechanic determind its direction.
In our previous generation robot, we use the "Parallel steering" mechanism in which the wheels angle is equal on both side. With this
mechanism, we encounter alot of sliping at both front and back of the car which made it drift and lose its balance. So after our research,
we decided to use the "Akerman steering" mechanism. But there are two type of this particular mechanism; "Akerman",which is use globally in any manufactured cars and "Anti-Akerman", which is commonly use in formula series racing cars. "Akerman steering" is when a car is turning, the steering angle is different on both wheel with a tigher angle on the inside and a wider angle on the other side because while turnng the inside wheel turn at a smaller radius while the outside wheel is turning at a larger radius. This eliminate the scrubing(sliding) of the tires and made the turn more smooth. The "Anti-Akerman" on the other hand is the opposite with the outside wheel turnig at a thigher angle generate more grip which is need in a formula car, but it is more difficult to control (the down force generate by formula cars compensate these flaws).
In short, the "Akerman steering" mechanism is out best choice and will definitely improve out robot.

 **How We Steer the Robot**

#### **LEGO Technic Differential gear** 
<p align="center">
 <img width="400" height="400" alt="LEGO Differential gear" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/eFEAAOSwqidiC8im/s-l1200.jpg"/>

A differential gear (commonly called a differential) is a special gear system used in vehicles to allow the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds while still being powered by the same engine or motor. When combined with the Ackermann steering mechanism, it enables smoother and more efficient movement for our robot.

You might wonder, “Why LEGO?” The reason is that our school has limited facilities, which prevents us from manufacturing our own components. As a result, we rely on pre-manufactured LEGO parts. According to the regulations, teams are not allowed to use a pre-built chassis, but standard parts are permitted.

Using LEGO parts not only ensures that the differential gear works reliably, but also allows us to easily obtain multiple identical spare parts when needed.

The System includes multiple parts:
   -Technic, Gear Differential Housing : 65414
   -Technic, Gear 12 Tooth Bevel : 6589
   -Technic, Gear 28 Tooth Double Bevel with Pin Hole : 65413

### Energy management and inspection
#### Gravity: URM09 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor 
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" alt="LEGO Wheel and Tire Set 2" src="https://github.com/Frances9/SEN0307/blob/master/DFR0307_WIKI_Cover.jpg?raw=true"/>

This is an ultrasonic sensor with an open dual-probe, employing standard interface of Gravity PH2.0-3P vertical patch socket. The module is compatible with controllers with 3.3V or 5V logical level, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

The sensor comes with built-in temperature compensation, which can greatly reduce measurement error caused by over high/low temperature.

We use a red sensor to detect the blue line, and a blue sensor to detect the red line. The reason is that optical sensors detect objects more effectively when the emitted light wavelength is different from the color of the target surface. The contrast between the sensor light and the line color increases the reflection difference, resulting in higher accuracy and more reliable detection.

**Description**
This module contains a TCRT5000, which integrates an infrared LED and a phototransistor in a single package. When power is supplied, the LED emits infrared light in a wide beam. If an object is placed in front of the sensor, the phototransistor receives the reflected infrared light and allows current to flow. This generates a voltage drop at the S (Vout) pin. The output voltage level depends on the intensity of the reflected infrared light received by the phototransistor — stronger reflections result in higher output voltage, while weaker reflections produce lower voltage.

The TCRT5000 Infrared Reflectance Obstacle Avoidance Line Tracking Sensor is an optical sensor that utilizes infrared (IR) light technology to detect objects and reflective surfaces. It works by emitting infrared light through an IR LED, and then measuring the amount of light reflected back to its built-in phototransistor.

Because of this simple yet effective principle, the TCRT5000 is widely used in robotics and automation projects. One of its most common applications is in line-following robots, where the sensor can distinguish between dark lines and light backgrounds by measuring differences in IR reflectivity. Additionally, it can serve as a short-range proximity sensor, making it suitable for obstacle detection, object counting, and motion tracking systems.

This sensor is popular among students, hobbyists, and engineers alike due to its low cost, compact design, and reliable performance. Its versatility and ease of integration make it an excellent choice for educational projects, competitions, and prototype development.

int ledPin = 13;
int sensor = A0;
int val = 0;
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //Serial.println("ArduinoAll TEST");
}
void loop() {
  val = analogRead(sensor);  //อ่านค่าจากเซนเซอร์
  Serial.println(val); // แสดงค่าเซนเซอร์ออกทางหน้าจอ
  if (val > 500) { // ค่า 500 สามารถกำหนดปรับได้ตามค่าแสงในห้องต่างๆ
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // ไฟ LED ติด
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // ไฟ LED ดับ
  }
